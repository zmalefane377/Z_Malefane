								<!--p>In week two, we focused on ideating and illustrating our design concepts while exploring the basics of raster manipulation. We learned how to express ideas through sketching and began using CAD tools to create simple digital representations of our designs. The session also introduced raster images, showing how they can be imported, adjusted, or traced within CAD software to support accurate design development. This combination of creativity, digital illustration, and image manipulation provided a strong foundation for moving from conceptual ideas to structured technical designs.</p-->

						<li>Designing the first model for first time trial</li>
                                    <li>Now that we are familiar with the 3D designing...we can carry on to add more details. Below is the face of a wrist watch. </li>

							<li>Below is the effect of high heat and mistakes done before and during the printing. As you can see the constrast in colour as well as the burn. the uncircled one is the attempt with better settings</li>

							<li>The second prototype printed.(A bottle)</li>

						<!--li>The 3D scanning using the phone</li>	
						  	<li>The first thing to is to take as many pictures as there could be of the same object in different angles.</li>

						     <p>Week One provided a solid introduction to the fundamentals of software development, combining both technical skills and professional practices. Learning Git highlighted the importance of version control, while programming exercises strengthened problem-solving and logical thinking. Building simple web pages helped translate abstract concepts into practical outcomes. Though some tasks, such as mastering <b>Git</b> commands and debugging, were initially challenging, they fostered patience, persistence, and methodical thinking. Documenting each step emphasized clarity, organization, and accountability. Overall, this week laid a strong foundation, equipping me with the skills and mindset to tackle future tasks confidently.</p>
